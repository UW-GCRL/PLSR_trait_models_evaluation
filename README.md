## Summary
* Leaf traits are essential for understanding many physiological and ecological processes. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models with leaf spectroscopy are widely applied for trait estimation, but their transferability across space, time and plant functional types (PFTs) remains unclear.
* We compiled a novel dataset of paired leaf traits and spectra, with 47,393 records for >700 species and eight PFTs at 101 globally-distributed locations across multiple seasons. Using this dataset, we conducted an unprecedented comprehensive analysis to assess the transferability of PLSR models in estimating leaf traits.
* While PLSR models demonstrate commendable performance in predicting chlorophyll content, carotenoid, leaf water and leaf mass per area prediction within their training data space, their efficacy diminishes when extrapolating to new contexts. Specifically, extrapolating to locations, seasons, and PFTs beyond the training data leads to reduced _R<sup>2</sup>_ (0.12-0.49, 0.15-0.42, and 0.25-0.56) and increased _NRMSE_ (3.58-18.24%, 6.27-11.55% and 7.0-33.12%) compared to nonspatial random cross-validation (NRCV). The results underscore the importance of incorporating greater spectral diversity in model training to boost its transferability.
* These findings highlight potential errors in estimating leaf traits over multiple domains due to biased validation schemes and provide guidance for future field sampling strategies and remote sensing applications.

## Description of compiled dataset

  * Total carotenoid content (Ccar, µg/cm<sup>2</sup>): 4,233 samples;
  * Equivalent water thickness (EWT, g/m<sup>2</sup>; a.k.a., leaf water content): 3,581 samples;
  * Leaf mass per area (LMA; g/m<sup>2</sup>): 45,417 samples.
2. Total 47,393 measurements, more than 700 species and 8 PFTs at 101 globally-distributed locations.
